# signal processing project
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed to simulate and visualize the mathematical principles of signals and systems. Unlike traditional time-domain simulations, this project operates directly on spectral lines, allowing for precise visualization of how frequencies shift and replicate during the sampling process.
